[Google Assistant][GoogleAssistant] is an AI-powered voice assistant that runs on the Raspberry Pi and x86 platforms and interact via the [DialogFlow][comp] integration with Home-Assistant. You can also use [Google Actions][GoogleActions] to extend its functionality.

1. Open the project. In the left side of the page go to Device Registration and fill the form out. (you can use any name for the device or the company) 
1. Download and save the ````credentials.jsonË™``` file

Now install and activate the [Samba] add-on so you can upload your credential file. Connect to the "share" Samba share and copy your credentials over. Name the file `google_assistant.json`.

Next in the Audio crad select the correct deices for the Assistant to use

Now it's time to start Google Assistant for the first time. 

The next step is to authenticate your Google account with Google Assistant. Start the add-on and click on the "OPEN WEB UI" button to start authentication.
